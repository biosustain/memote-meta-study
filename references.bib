              for scientific progress. Computational experiments are scriptable
              and should be easy to reproduce. However, computational analyses

              may be difficult or impossible to match using written
              instructions. We report the development of continuous analysis, a
              workflow that enables reproducible computational analyses.
              Continuous analysis combines Docker, a container technology akin
              to virtual machines, with continuous integration, a software
              development technique, to automatically rerun a computational
              analysis whenever updates or improvements are made to source code
              or data. This enables researchers to reproduce results without
              contacting the study authors. Continuous analysis allows
              reviewers, editors or readers to verify reproducibility without
              manually downloading and rerunning code and can provide an audit

                   physicochemically and biochemically feasible phenotypic

                   of interoperable COBRA methods. It has found widespread
                   applications in biology, biomedicine, and biotechnology
                   because its functions can be flexibly combined to implement
                   tailored COBRA protocols for any biochemical network.
                   Version 3.0 includes new methods for quality controlled
                   reconstruction, modelling, topological analysis, strain and
                   experimental design, network visualisation as well as
                   network integration of chemoinformatic, metabolomic,
                   transcriptomic, proteomic, and thermochemical data. New
                   multi-lingual code integration also enables an expansion in
                   COBRA application scope via high-precision,
                   high-performance, and nonlinear numerical optimisation
                   solvers for multi-scale, multi-cellular and reaction kinetic

                   the generation and analysis of a constraint-based model in a
                   wide variety of molecular systems biology scenarios. This

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA)
              methods are widely used for genome-scale modeling of metabolic
              networks in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Due to the successes
              with metabolism, there is an increasing effort to apply COBRA
              methods to reconstruct and analyze integrated models of cellular
              processes. The COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB is a leading software
              package for genome-scale analysis of metabolism; however, it was
              not designed to elegantly capture the complexity inherent in
              integrated biological networks and lacks an integration framework
              for the multiomics data used in systems biology. The openCOBRA
              Project is a community effort to promote constraints-based
              research through the distribution of freely available software.
              RESULTS: Here, we describe COBRA for Python (COBRApy), a Python
              package that provides support for basic COBRA methods. COBRApy is
              designed in an object-oriented fashion that facilitates the
              representation of the complex biological processes of metabolism
              and gene expression. COBRApy does not require MATLAB to function;
              however, it includes an interface to the COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB
              to facilitate use of legacy codes. For improved performance,
              COBRApy includes parallel processing support for computationally
              intensive processes. CONCLUSION: COBRApy is an object-oriented
              framework designed to meet the computational challenges
              associated with the next generation of stoichiometric
              constraint-based models and high-density omics data sets.

  abstract = "Reconstructing metabolic pathways has long been a focus of active
              research. Now, draft models can be generated from genomic
              annotation and used to simulate metabolic fluxes of mass and
              energy at the whole-cell scale. This approach has led to an
              explosion in the number of functional metabolic network models.
              However, more models have not led to expanded coverage of
              metabolic reactions known to occur in the biosphere. Thus, there
              exists opportunity to reconsider the process of reconstruction
              and model derivation to better support the less-scalable
              investigative processes of biocuration and experimentation.
              Realizing this opportunity to improve our knowledge of metabolism
              requires developing new tools that make reconstructions more
              useful by highlighting metabolic network knowledge limitations to
              guide future research.",
